# Toronto Public Library Books Due

I keep getting fines because books are due.
I want to automatically grab the due books list from
the website and give me a list of books and when they
are do -- so I can run it every day.

You need to add your library card number and PIN into
a `secrets.py` file -- that is ignored by git.

## TO DO

* check for holds
* write output to a file (or should this be done through bash)
* highlight if books are overdue, due today, due tomorrow or due in 2 days
